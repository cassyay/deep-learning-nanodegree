### Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns <br>
**Summary** 
- Build a neural network from scratch using only `python` and the `NumPy` library
- Time-series data used to predict daily bike rental ridership
- Predict bike sharing patterns from previously aggregated daily and hourly bike sharing counts, from the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) <br>

**Project criteria**
- code and implement sigmoid activation function
- implement forward pass for training
- implement backward pass for every batch, and correctly update weight change
- implement input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights 
- select number of epochs so the model can accuractely make predictions, and not overfit 
- select number of hidden nodes so model can generalize, and not overfit
- select learning rate so the network converges while remaining time efficient
- select correct number of output nodes
